            Technical Projects
        </h4>
        <p>Over the years of my computer science learning, I have done several
            of computer science projects.

            One of my projects has involved analyzing the run-time of search Algorithms.
            I used excel and java to collect data and make a graph out of it.

            There were numerous times when I had to use subclasses in projects, such as "animals"
            to avoid repetitive code.
