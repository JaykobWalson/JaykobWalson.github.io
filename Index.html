        <p1>Hello! My name is Jaykob Walson. I am a student at the University of Puget Sound.
            I haven't been engineering with computer science for a long time, but I'm in the midst of learning.

            I was born on September 22nd, 2000 in Durham, NC. I have lived in Nairobi, Kenya from 2005-08. When I am not at
            my college, I live in Seattle, WA.

            The first time I have ever coded was when I was in my senior year of high school.
            I wasn't very good at it, but with some help, ever since last year, I managed to get the hang of it.
            I hope to find a career that involves some computer science, which explains why I'm majoring in that topic.
